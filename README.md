# Rock, Paper or Scissors

Rock, Paper or Scissors is a study app made using SwiftUI, being part of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws).

The idea of this project is to solidify the main concepts learned on the previous chapters of 100 Days of SwiftUI.
